# DECENTRALIZED TWITTER
Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms and is widely adopted by various communities and users from different industries. But like most existing social media platforms, Twitter is centralized. Sure, the social media giant is implementing some crypto features, such as using NFTs (non-fungible tokens) as profile pictures. However, users of the platform face censorship, account blocking, shadowbanning, etc., daily. Fortunately, Web3 provides excellent solutions for these issues.
